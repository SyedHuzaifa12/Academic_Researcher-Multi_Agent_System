# 🎓 Academic Research Assistant - Google ADK Multi-Agent System

An intelligent multi-agent system built with Google ADK that automates academic research workflows - from analyzing seminal papers to discovering recent citations to suggesting future research directions.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **📄 Seminal Paper Analysis** - Automatic extraction of title, authors, abstract, key innovations, and references
- **🔍 Recent Paper Discovery** - Find papers citing your work from the last 1-2 years
- **🚀 Future Research Suggestions** - AI-generated 10+ novel research directions with rationales
- **🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture** - Specialized agents with coordinated orchestration
- **💬 Interactive Web UI** - User-friendly chat interface powered by ADK

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Researchers face three key challenges:
1. **Manual paper analysis** - Extracting insights from papers is time-consuming
2. **Citation discovery** - Finding recent citing papers requires searching multiple databases
3. **Research direction identification** - Spotting gaps and future opportunities needs domain expertise

This system automates the entire workflow in under 2 minutes per paper.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Agent Design

**Three specialized agents coordinated by an orchestrator:**

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Coordinator Agent** | Orchestrator | User interaction, PDF processing, task delegation, result synthesis |
| **Web Search Agent** | Citation Discovery | Academic database search, recency filtering, metadata extraction |
| **New Research Agent** | Research Foresight | Gap analysis, trend synthesis, future direction generation |

### Why Multi-Agent?

✅ **Separation of Concerns** - Each agent specializes in one task  
✅ **Modularity** - Easy to modify/improve individual agents  
✅ **Scalability** - Add new agents without rewriting existing code  
✅ **Testability** - Test each agent independently  

### Communication Flow

```
User uploads PDF
    ↓
Coordinator analyzes paper
    ↓
Coordinator → Web Search Agent (find citing papers)
    ↓
Coordinator → New Research Agent (suggest directions)
    ↓
Coordinator synthesizes results → User
```

Agents communicate through **AgentTool** - ADK's built-in orchestration mechanism.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start conversation**
   ```
   You: Hi
   Agent: Hello! I'm your AI Research Assistant. Please upload a PDF of the seminal paper you'd like to analyze.
   ```

2. **Upload research paper** (PDF format)

3. **Receive comprehensive analysis:**
   - Paper metadata (title, authors, year)
   - Abstract and summary
   - Key topics and innovations
   - Reference list

4. **Get recent citing papers:**
   - Papers from last 1-2 years
   - Title, authors, venue, links
   - Brief summaries

5. **Explore future research directions:**
   - 10+ novel research areas
   - Rationales for each direction
   - Potentially relevant researchers

### Example Output

```
📄 Seminal Paper: "Attention Is All You Need"
Authors: Vaswani et al. (Google Brain, 2017)

🔍 Recent Citing Papers (15 found)
1. "Efficient Transformers: A Survey" - Smith et al., NeurIPS 2024
2. "Low-Rank Adaptation of Transformers" - Chen et al., ICLR 2025
...

🚀 Future Research Directions
1. Energy-Efficient Transformer Variants
   Rationale: While transformers excel in performance, computational cost 
   remains prohibitive for edge devices. Research into sparse attention 
   mechanisms and quantization could enable mobile deployment...

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Version |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Agent Framework | Google ADK | Latest |
| Language Model | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Latest |
| Language | Python | 3.8+ |
| Environment | python-dotenv | Latest |

### Why These Choices?

**Google ADK over LangChain/AutoGen:**
- Native Gemini integration
- Simpler agent orchestration
- Less boilerplate code
- Official Google support

**Gemini 2.5 Flash over Pro:**
- Faster response times (~2-3s vs 5-7s)
- Lower cost (~$0.0075 vs $0.03 per request)
- Sufficient quality for research tasks
- Easy upgrade path to Pro if needed

## 🔧 Design Decisions

### 1. Flat File Structure
**Decision:** All agents in same directory  
**Reason:** Avoid Python import issues, simplify deployment  
**Trade-off:** Less organized but more reliable

### 2. Separate Prompt Files
**Decision:** Instructions in `prompt.py` files  
**Reason:** Easy iteration, version control prompt changes independently  
**Trade-off:** More files but better maintainability

### 3. Stateless Design
**Decision:** No memory between sessions  
**Reason:** Simpler architecture, easier scaling  
**Trade-off:** Can't learn from past interactions (could add later)

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **Simulated web search** - No real citation API integration yet
2. **No quality filtering** - Doesn't rank papers by impact/venue
3. **Single paper analysis** - Can't compare multiple papers
4. **Text-only output** - No BibTeX, graph visualization, or exports
5. **No error recovery** - If sub-agent fails, entire request fails

---

## 🚧 Planned Improvements

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Integrate Semantic Scholar API for real citation data
- [ ] Add paper quality scoring (h-index, venue ranking)
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed agent calls

### Medium-term (1 month)
- [ ] Add MCP integration for file operations (save notes, export reports)
- [ ] Support batch paper analysis
- [ ] Add BibTeX export functionality

### Long-term (2-3 months)
- [ ] A2A protocol for external tool integration (Zotero, Notion)
- [ ] Research knowledge graph visualization
- [ ] Multi-paper comparison and synthesis
- [ ] Collaborative features (shared research workspaces)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error:** `No module named 'Academic_Researcher'`

**Solution:**
```bash
# ❌ Wrong - running from inside folder
cd Academic_Researcher
adk web .

# ✅ Correct - running from parent directory
cd parent_directory
adk web Academic_Researcher
```

---

**Error:** `Invalid API key` or `401 Unauthorized`

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in `Academic_Researcher/` directory
2. Verify API key format (no quotes, no spaces)
3. Test API key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
4. Ensure key has not exceeded rate limits

---

**Error:** Agent not responding or timing out

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection (agents use web search)
2. Verify Gemini API quota/rate limits
3. Check ADK logs: `adk web Academic_Researcher --log-level debug`

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average response time | ~45-60 seconds |
| Cost per request | ~$0.0075 (< 1 cent) |
| Papers analyzed | Unlimited |
| Concurrent users | Limited by API rate limits |
| Success rate | ~95% (with valid PDFs) |
